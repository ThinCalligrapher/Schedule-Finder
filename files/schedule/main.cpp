// so we are going to need 1: how many users
// 2: enter their schedules
// 3: save the schedules to a text file
// 4: compare the schedules
// 5: find when all users are open
// 6: find down to 1 when users are open
// 7: find when no users are open


// for the comparisons we are going to use bitwise comparison
// and compare them against eachother
// and then compile a vector of integers
// and sum up each integer for together
// and maybe link that to a map
// and in the map it will be hmmm
// so we have a vector 8 9 10 etc
// 8 is all 9 is none
// so for each 8, we will have a vector of strings
// and each new find will add to that map a new string
        // user () is open at 8
        // user () is open at 9
    // and the vector will tell us most - least
    // perhaps a pair - but are they mutable? Im pretty sure

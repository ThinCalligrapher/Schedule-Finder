What this program does: Takes in schedules of users, then compares them to find matches and represents them graphically

How it’s structured: Users are stored as class objects in an array. Schedule stored as integer, bitwise comparison to match schedules

Main execution flow: I need to fix this, make persistent memory. Supposed to be a persistent program, can come back to it and check schedules, access specific users, and add/delete. 

Key data structures: unordered map to store matches. integer representation for indivdual schedules. Soon to be json representation or text file with custom formatting?

What’s incomplete / broken: presistent memory, external file, all matches, 4, 3 and so on

Next thing to work on: creating persistent memory, checking if users already exist, menu with options for which direction to take, ascii art

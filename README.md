What this program does: Takes in schedules of users, then compares them to find matches and represents them graphically
How it’s structured: Users are stored as class objects in an array
Main execution flow: I need to fix this, make persistent memory
Key data structures: unordered map to store matches. integer representation for indivdual schedules
What’s incomplete / broken: presistent memory, external file, all matches, 4, 3 and so on
Next thing to work on: moving functions and class to .h file
